Nice to see you,
But beg - leave me alone.
I'm waiting here,
And won't to be seen together.

Man,
look at the circles running from sun,
Then look at the moon -
The same, one by one,
Inside then out.
Cool, right?

Why do you staring at me like this?
It's just how light work, isn't it?

Did you ever hear pulse of light,
The pulse of the stairs and planets?
Don't depreciate how great its value!
It's holiest thing!
It's only should bother you!

Stop, why it should ever bother me...
I mean...
What do you trying convince me in?

Convince? I just saying I looking sense...
You know, I knocked every god damn door.
Even knowing there is nobody behind it...

And you know, this street so cold -
Even my tears freeze.
Winter caught everyone in her cage.
And probably won't release...

I feeling myself as a teardrop,
That get lost in the world's bristle!
I'm a wire that birds sitting on.
Damn, my life isn't funny...
Could you borrow me bit of money?
