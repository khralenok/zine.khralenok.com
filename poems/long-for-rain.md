Faded leaves have longed for rain for years
Cracked ground is begging for it already.
A stranger faces the sky at another dawn,
Throwing a scornful glance at the clean heavens.

Bottles, hookers, rats, and drugs!
Look how beautiful this dump is—
Rails like stairs lead straight to heaven,
While Death watches the feast like a raven.

Wash it away!

And one night, your drops hit my window glass.
With Morse code, you send me thousands of messages,
Telling me your life was like flipping through empty pages,
How cold and impregnable your cage seemed to be.

But my cruel heart, dried and empty,
Will gaze at the drops and cry.

It doesn’t matter if you were hurt,
You never came... Oh, forgive me, Lord!
You lay there, so dead, unmoving,
Even the graveyard stones
Seem more alive than you!

Life is motion!

By morning, the windows will be crystal clear,
No bottles, no rats, no thirst, no fear.
The clear sky no longer seems hopeless,
And the ground will have absorbed the last rain droplets.
