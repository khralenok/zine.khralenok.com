A bowl full of mice
Their tiny voices rise.

“Should I eat them?”
I lower my eyes.

“Eat, dear, eat…”
Says a voice behind,
“It’s just mice,
So never mind.”

But one jumps onto the table,
Then the rest take flight.
"Let’s start a rebellion,
We'll put up a fight!"

They dash by the shelves, the floor, the window,
Slip under the door, through a crack, and… bingo!

Step by step, they escape to freedom,
Far from the clutches of this strange, cruel kingdom.
Leaving the world of people behind,
Returning to the life by nature designed.
