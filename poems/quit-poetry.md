Was it a hurricane,
Or just an airplane flying by?
I threw my papers into the fire.
"That's it! Done with poetry."

Paper ships follow the green icebreaker,
I cling to the ground.
I left life for later.

My poems burn,
All my thoughts burn.
What's more beautiful â€” Death,
Or something new being born?

We've sung, we've played all
That was possible.

But the fire so perfectly matches the burning sun,
And words in my mind start to dance and run.
Will I ever quit writing?
Well, that's something I'll never have done.
