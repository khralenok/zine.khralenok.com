There are tons of unfinished thoughts in my mind,
Thankfully, memory is just a strain -
No matter how hard your try to keep them,
They just go, to come later alain.

There are skyscrappers of written sheets,
Brain squeak so loud I can hardly sleep,
Create!
Give a birth!

Give birth and then die
For the rest who won't ever exist

I'd jump in puddles as child or lunatic,
Watching sun drawing it's laceon on my closed eyes.
Then I'd fell in a moist grass,
Throwing hands by sides,

Catch some noise, and feels it like melody
I'd come with something of world wide size.
