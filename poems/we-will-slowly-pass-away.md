We will slowly pass away,
Leaving white trails on the blue background,
Waiting for heat, then for refreshing colds,
Listening phone beeps’s monotone sound.

We will smoke cigarettes one by one,
Taking them from our bottomless pockets,
Gazing at others’ trails in the sky,
Staring at faces of the TV prophets.

We will probably make just nothing,
Keeping our tears deep inside our souls.
Answering “Yes” or “No” to questions.
Hearing unstoppable step of our fall.

Always waiting for something eternal,
Not seeing the point of what we were born for
Day by day hanging on the time’s funeral,
We will eventually also die.
